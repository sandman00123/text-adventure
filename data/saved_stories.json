You navigate through the debris, determined to confront Kronak the Ruthless. As you turn a corner, you spot a hunched figure scavenging through the wreckage. It’s Old Mara, a once-proud warrior now reduced to rummaging for scraps. Her gray hair whips wildly in the wind, and her sunken eyes flash with a mix of fear and defiance. \n\n“Beware, traveler! Kronak's shadow looms large,” she rasps. \n\nYou sense that Mara holds valuable information. Will you approach her and ask for guidance?"

At the edge of town, you find Elder Maeve, her eyes sharp and vibrant despite her weathered skin. She paces restlessly, muttering about strategies and defenses. “We can’t let them take Havenbrook. Not again,” she says, clenching her fists tight. “The military depot holds our chance. We have to act fast.” \n\nWith her fierce determination echoing in your mind, you can either head to the depot first or gather the townsfolk for a defense plan. What do you choose?"
